# Stone Implementation Plan

This document outlines the architecture and implementation details of the Stone framework.

## Architecture Overview

Stone is a TypeScript/Node.js "software factory" for orchestrating GitHub-based development using Claude AI. It breaks down feature work into specialized roles with clear responsibilities and a standardized workflow.

The main components of Stone are:

1. **Roles**: Specialized roles (PM, QA, Feature Developer, Auditor, Actions Runner) with defined responsibilities.
2. **Config**: Configuration management for Stone projects.
3. **GitHub Client**: Wrapper around Octokit for GitHub API interactions.
4. **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the workflow between roles.
5. **GitHub Actions**: Generates and manages GitHub Actions workflows.
6. **Webhook Handler**: Processes GitHub webhook events.
7. **Performance**: Rate limiting and request batching for API calls.
8. **Security**: Access control and security features.
9. **CLI**: Command-line interface for Stone operations.

## Component Implementation

### Roles

Each role is implemented as a class extending the base `Role` class:

- **PM Role**: Creates Gherkin specifications based on issue descriptions.
- **QA Role**: Creates test files based on Gherkin specifications.
- **Feature Role**: Implements features based on specifications and tests.
- **Auditor Role**: Verifies implementations against specifications and tests.
- **Actions Role**: Creates GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

Each role has a specific prompt template for Claude AI and handles its part of the workflow.

### Config

The configuration system consists of:

- **Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for the configuration.
- **Loader**: Loads and validates configuration files.
- **Generator**: Generates default configurations based on repository analysis.
- **Analyzer**: Analyzes repository structure for configuration generation.

### GitHub Client

The GitHub client wraps Octokit to provide:

- Issue and PR management
- Comment and label operations
- File content operations
- Repository information retrieval

### Workflow Engine

The workflow engine orchestrates the process:

- **StoneWorkflow**: Main class for workflow orchestration.
- **ConflictResolution**: Handles merge conflicts.
- **FeedbackHandler**: Processes feedback on issues.
- **DocsManager**: Manages documentation updates.
- **ErrorRecovery**: Handles workflow errors.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions integration includes:

- **WorkflowGenerator**: Generates GitHub Actions workflow files.
- **Webhook Handler**: Processes GitHub webhook events.

### Performance

Performance optimizations include:

- **RateLimiter**: Implements token bucket algorithm for API rate limiting.
- **RequestBatcher**: Batches individual requests into grouped API calls.

### Security

Security features include:

- **AccessControlManager**: Role-based access control for files and operations.
- **SecretRedaction**: Redacts secrets from text.
- **MergeProtection**: Enforces merge protections.

### CLI

The CLI provides commands for:

- **init**: Initialize Stone configuration.
- **process**: Process an issue with Stone.
- **status**: Show status of Stone issues.
- **run**: Run a specific workflow.
- **reset**: Reset Stone labels on an issue.
- **actions**: Generate GitHub Actions workflows.
- **dashboard**: Start a web dashboard for Stone.

## Extension Points

Stone is designed to be extensible through:

1. **Custom Roles**: Add new roles by extending the base `Role` class.
2. **Workflow Customization**: Customize the workflow by modifying the `StoneWorkflow` class.
3. **Prompt Templates**: Customize Claude AI prompts for each role.
4. **GitHub Actions**: Customize GitHub Actions workflows.

## Testing Strategy

Stone includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete workflow.

## Deployment

Stone is deployed as an npm package and can be installed globally or as a project dependency.
