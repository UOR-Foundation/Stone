# Convert Performance and Scalability Tests to Jest

## Summary
This PR converts the performance and scalability component tests from Mocha/Chai to Jest syntax. These tests were previously skipped in PR #15 to unblock the security component integration.

## Changes
- Converted all performance component tests to Jest:
  - rate-limiter.test.ts
  - request-batcher.test.ts
  - performance-monitor.test.ts
  - parallel-executor.test.ts
- Converted repository-optimizer.test.ts from scalability component to Jest
- Removed the testPathIgnorePatterns for performance and scalability in jest.config.js
- Ensured all tests pass with the Jest framework

## Testing
- All tests now pass with `npm test`
- TypeScript type checking confirms no type errors
- Verified that assertion syntax matches Jest expectations (using toBe, toEqual, etc.)

## Notes
- The test conversion preserves all the original test scenarios while making them compatible with Jest
- The scalability tests still have limited coverage and will need additional work in future PRs
- This completes the migration of all existing test files to the Jest framework
